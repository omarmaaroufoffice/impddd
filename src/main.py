"""
Main entry point for the macOS UI Automation System.

This application leverages advanced AI task planning and UI automation
to execute high-level user commands with a grid‐based screen mapper.
The system is designed for macOS, utilizing AppleScript for hotkey and
terminal command execution. The main module initializes the QApplication,
loads configuration and environment variables, sets up logging, and begins
the event loop.

Modules:
    - ai_controller: Orchestrates AI task planning, execution, and UI verification.
    - PySide6: Provides the cross‐platform UI framework.
    - Logging and environment modules for robust configuration.
    
Usage:
    $ python3 src/main.py

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Detailed Comments and Future Considerations:
#
# 1. Robustness: The application includes multiple levels of error handling,
#    particularly around environment configuration, AIController initialization,
#    and UI event handling. Future releases may introduce more granular exception
#    management strategies, including individual error recoveries for specific modules.
#
# 2. Performance: The use of caching for screenshots and the asynchronous
#    processing via QThread ensures that the UI remains responsive. Any observed
#    performance bottlenecks will be profiled and optimized.
#
# 3. Security: All user inputs and AI-generated commands are validated to ensure
#    that no unauthorized operations are executed. Environment variables are used
#    to store sensitive information like API keys.
#
# 4. Extensibility: The code is designed with a modular structure. Future features
#    can plug into the AIController or ScreenMapper modules with minimal code changes.
#
# 5. Testing: Comprehensive unit tests and integration tests will be developed,
#    particularly focusing on edge cases such as invalid inputs and API failures.
#
# 6. Logging: The logging system is fully configurable. Log levels can be adjusted,
#    and logs are output to both a file and the console. This ensures ease of debugging.
#
# 7. Concurrency: The application leverages PySide6's threading and event filters to
#    manage concurrency. Future improvements may consider using asynchronous Python
#    features offered by asyncio.
#
# 8. Code Maintenance: Detailed comments and a strict separation of concerns ensure
#    that the code remains maintainable over time.
#
# 9. UI Considerations: The automation control window is designed to remain atop other
#    windows for easy reference during automation processes.
#
# 10. Error Scenarios: The application logs detailed error messages and attempts to recover
#     gracefully from various failure scenarios. Any unrecoverable error leads to a controlled
#     shutdown, ensuring no critical data loss.
